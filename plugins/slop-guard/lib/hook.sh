# lib/hook.sh — hook I/O contract: stdin decode, response encode, exit codes.
#
# §3.2: a hook receives JSON on stdin exactly once; read it here and cache it so
# nothing downstream consumes the stream (aisdlc:318-320 exists for this reason).
#
# Public interface:
#   hook_input               — read stdin once into _HOOK_INPUT (call at entry)
#   hook_field  <jq-path>    — extract a field; empty for null/missing
#   hook_deny   <reason>     — deny, or add context in advisory mode
#   hook_secret_deny <reason> — always deny secret access/content
#   hook_allow               — permit explicitly; silent on Grok (exit 0 = allow)
#   hook_context <text>      — additionalContext JSON on stdout (stderr on Grok)
#   hook_message <text>      — systemMessage JSON on stdout (stderr on Grok)
#
# Exit-code contract (§3.2):
#   exit 0 + JSON on stdout  — structured decision (use these helpers)
#   exit 2                   — blocking error; reason on stderr
#   exit 1 / other           — non-blocking; action proceeds
#
# All JSON is built with jq -n --arg; never by string-concatenating, because a
# reason containing a double-quote would emit invalid JSON and Claude would
# silently ignore the decision.
#
# additionalContext is written as a statement of fact, never as a system-style
# order — prompt-injection defences may trigger on imperative text (§3.2).

# Runtime detection — set once when this library is sourced.
# Grok injects GROK_PLUGIN_ROOT (and GROK_PLUGIN_DATA, GROK_WORKSPACE_ROOT) and
# does not set CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT; bin/slopguard seeds the latter from the
# former before invoking a hook, so on Grok the two agree.
# Presence of GROK_PLUGIN_ROOT alone is NOT sufficient evidence: a Claude
# session that inherited a stale GROK_PLUGIN_ROOT would then be answered in the
# Grok envelope, which Claude ignores — every deny would become a silent allow.
